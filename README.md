# Full-Image-Processing-Code-in-Python
Image processing project using Python and OpenCV. It covers grayscale conversion, blurring, edge detection, contour drawing, and image resizing with visual output

##  Features

- Load and display images using OpenCV and Matplotlib
- Convert images to grayscale
- Apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise
- Detect edges using the Canny algorithm
- Find and draw object contours
- Resize processed images while maintaining aspect ratio
- Save final output image
- View each image processing step immediately after execution (great for learning!)

##  Technologies Used

- Python 3
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- Matplotlib
- 
##  Getting Started

1. Upload your image to Google Colab
2. Run the notebook cells step-by-step
3. View and understand each processing stage visually
4. Download the final processed image

##  Example Steps

| Step              | Output Description             |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Original Image    | Unedited input image          |
| Grayscale         | Black and white version       |
| Gaussian Blur     | Smoothed image                |
| Canny Edge        | Edges highlighted             |
| Contour Drawing   | Green outlines of shapes      |
| Resized Output    | Final image, scaled and saved |
